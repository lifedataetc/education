    Please keep posts not related to course material outside of the QA forums. Instead post this to our chat channel.

7. I'm getting an error saying "File not Found", what should I do?
    There are only 2 ways to get this error:
        1.) You mis-spelled the file name, make sure to double check this.
        2.) You provided the wrong file path. Try manually checking the full file path and providing the file path.
        These really are the only two possibilities for this error. If you run our files directly from their location, they are gauranteed not to have this error, so please double check those files first before posting this to the QA forums!
